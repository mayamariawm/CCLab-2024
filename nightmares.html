                In a world where thoughts take shape, there exists a creature known as Nightmares. It lurks in the shadows of our minds, feeding on our deepest fears and insecurities. The more we try to avoid our fears, the stronger Nightmares becomes. You must be careful not to let Nightmares touch you, for each contact causes it to grow even more rapidly, your fears multiplying and intensifying. The creature becomes a swirling mass of your worst thoughts, threatening to consume your entire being. The path is not easy. Sometimes, Nightmares will catch you off guard, growing suddenly when you least expect it. But you persist, knowing that each setback is temporary, each confrontation making you more resilient. In the end, you stand tall, surrounded by the fading whispers of Nightmares, ready to face whatever new challenges your dreams may bring.
